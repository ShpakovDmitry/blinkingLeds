### Description
Program that runs on Atmel AVR architecture microcontroller.
Makes running light on 18 leds.
Light running direction is changed by button press.
For debug UART is used.
Also UART is used for running light speed adjustion.

### Cloning the project
To clone the project to your local directory, run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShpakovDmitry/blinkingLeds
```

### Tools used
To succesfully build the project following tools are required:
`gcc-avr, binutils-avr, avr-libc, make`
To flash the firmware `avrdude` is used.
To get the tools run the following commands in Debian Linux:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc make avrdude
```
Tested on **Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)**

### Project building
To build project run the following command:
```bash
make
```

### Firmware size
To check whether firmware fits to controller flash memory and there is
not SRAM over usage, run the following command:
```bash
make
avr-size ./build/blinkingLeds.o --mcu=attiny2313 --format=avr
```
The output will be something familiar:
```bash
AVR Memory Usage
----------------
Device: attiny2313

Program:    2508 bytes (122.5% Full)
(.text + .data + .bootloader)

Data:         47 bytes (36.7% Full)
(.data + .bss + .noinit)

```
### Before Flashing
Make sure that appropriate controller configuration
bits (fuses) are set correct, before flashing the firmware.
For current setup fuses are the following:
```bash
FUSE_EXTENDED_BYTE = 0xFF
FUSE_HIGH_BYTE = 0xDF
FUSE_LOW_BYTE = 0xFF
LOCK_BIT_BYTE = 0xFF
```

### Flashing the controller
For controller flashing `avrdude` is used.
Please refer to `avrdude` [homepage](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/) for online
documentation.

### Prototype
For code test purposes prototype was created. See image below.
